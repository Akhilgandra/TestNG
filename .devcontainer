//Explanation of the JSON fields:
name:

The name of the development container. In this case, it is "selenium-devcontainer".
This is used for identification purposes when working with multiple containers.
build:

Specifies how the container image should be built.
dockerfile:
Points to the location of the Dockerfile used to build the container.
Here, ../scripts/dev-image/Dockerfile is the relative path to the Dockerfile. This file likely contains the instructions to set up the container environment for Selenium development.
runArgs:

Specifies additional arguments to pass when running the container.
--name selenium_devcontainer:
This sets the name of the running container to selenium_devcontainer for easier identification.
Usage:
When opened in VS Code with the Remote - Containers extension, this configuration tells VS Code:
To build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
To run the resulting container with the specified name (selenium_devcontainer).
This setup ensures that all developers working on the Selenium project have a consistent environment, regardless of their local machine configuration.//
